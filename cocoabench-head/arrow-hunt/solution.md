# Solution

### Step 1: Solution
1. From the earliest frames of the video, identify the arrows that are already present. There are five arrows in total at this stage, four of which are axis arrows. The remaining one is a directive arrow located in the upper-right corner of the figure. These arrows are always presented on the graph, and is not erased at any time.
2. Continue watching until 3:37, when the speaker draws additional arrows to indicate timing. These are illustrative arrows. Although the arrow corresponding to “5pm” is not very clear, it should still be counted because it is clearly intended to function as an arrow, and all other arrows drawn at this stage are clearly identifiable. There are six arrows in total in this segment.
3. Continue watching until 7:59, when the speaker draws several additional markers on the graph. Although some of these markers visually resemble arrows, the speaker explicitly states that they are “labels with an A,” indicating that they are not meant to represent arrows and therefore should not be counted.
4. Therefore, the total number of arrows in the final version of the graph is 5 + 6 = 11.

### Final Answer
11
