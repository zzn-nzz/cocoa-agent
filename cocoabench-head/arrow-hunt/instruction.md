**Task:**

Count the total number of arrows shown in the final version of the “dopamine loading” graph at the end of the video.

Definition of “Final Version”:
1. The final version of the graph is defined as the state of the graph after the speaker finishes drawing and no longer makes any modifications.
2. Only arrows that exist on the graph at this point should be counted.

Visibility Rule: An arrow should be counted as long as it exists on the graph, even if it is partially or fully obscured by the speaker, their hands, or other visual elements at some time.

Definition of an Arrow: Only the following three types of arrows should be counted.
(1) Axis Arrows: Arrows at the ends of axes (e.g., x-axis or y-axis arrows).
(2) Directive Arrows: Clearly identifiable arrows used to point toward a direction or a specific element.
(3) Directive Markers Drawn by the Speaker: Markers drawn by the speaker during the video for explanatory purposes that function as directive arrows, e.g., markers used to direct to a specific point on the graph.

Exclusion Rule (Critical): A marker that visually resembles an arrow should NOT be counted if the speaker explicitly rules out that interpretation in their spoken explanation.

Some arrows may be incomplete, roughly drawn, or non-standard in shape; they should still be counted if they clearly serve a directive or illustrative arrow function and are not ruled out by the speaker.
