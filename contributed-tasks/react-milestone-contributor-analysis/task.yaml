  Analyze the **React 16.0** milestone on GitHub to understand contributor activity patterns.

  **Milestone URL:** https://github.com/facebook/react/milestone/23?closed=1

  **Task:**

  Analyze all **closed issues** in this milestone and answer the following questions:

  1. **Top Contributor**: Which user created the most issues in this milestone? How many issues did they create?

  2. **Most Discussed Issue**: Which issue has the highest number of comments? Report the issue number.

  3. **Bug Count**: How many issues have the label `Type: Bug`?

  **Important Notes:**
  - Only analyze **closed** issues in this milestone
  - Count issues, not pull requests (though on GitHub they may appear together)
  - For the "most discussed issue", count the comments shown on the issue page

  **Output Format:**

  Submit your answer in the following JSON format:

  ```
  <answer>
  {
    "top_contributor": "username",
    "top_contributor_issues": 17,
    "most_discussed_issue": 7311,
    "bug_count": 3
  }
  </answer>
  ```

  Replace the values with your findings. The issue number should be an integer without the `#` symbol.
