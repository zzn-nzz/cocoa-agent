instruction: |-
  Estimate how many linear regimes best explain y as a function of t. Return the regime count and breakpoint dates.

  **Output Format:**

  Return a JSON object wrapped in ```json code blocks with the following fields:

  ```json
  {
    "regime_count": <integer>,
    "breakpoints": [<date1>, <date2>, ...]
  }
  ```

  **Requirements:**
  - `regime_count` should be an integer
  - `breakpoints` should be listed in ascending order
  - Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - A tolerance of ±7 days is acceptable when evaluating breakpoint correctness

  You should download the data file using wget from the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benchworld/asset/main/series_bGluZWFyLXJlZ2ltZS1lc3RpbWF0aW9uLTI.csv. It contains columns: date, t, y.
